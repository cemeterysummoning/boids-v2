I compiled and ran my code on Ubuntu 24.04, using the specified `cmake ..` and `make` commands in the `build` directory. 

I didn't collaborate with any of my peers, but I did ask for some substantial help in office hours to figure out bugs in my renderer and SSD transformation code.

Similar to last time, I used the GLM library documentation extensively.
